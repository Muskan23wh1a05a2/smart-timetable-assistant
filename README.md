## 📁 Project Structure

```
student-calendar-agent/
├── app.py                  # Main Streamlit app (UI + tabs)
├── google_calendar.py      # Google Calendar API auth + CRUD helpers
├── schedule_store.py        # Local JSON storage for class schedule
├── requirements.txt         # Python dependencies
├── .gitignore               # Keeps credentials/tokens out of git
├── .streamlit/
│   └── config.toml          # Streamlit theme config
└── README.md                 # This file
```

---

## 1. Create the GitHub Repo

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Week 1-2: Foundation - calendar integration + class schedule"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/student-calendar-agent.git
git push -u origin main
```

---

## 2. Set Up Your Development Environment

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 3. Get Google Calendar API Credentials

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create a new project (or select an existing one).
3. Go to **APIs & Services → Library**, search for **Google Calendar API**, and click **Enable**.
4. Go to **APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen**:
   - Choose "External" (unless you have a Workspace account).
   - Fill in the required app info (app name, support email).
   - Add your own Google account as a **test user**.
5. Go to **APIs & Services → Credentials → Create Credentials → OAuth client ID**.
   - Application type: **Desktop app**
   - Name it anything, e.g. "Student Calendar Assistant"
6. Download the JSON file, rename it to `credentials.json`, and place it in
   the project root folder (same level as `app.py`).

> ⚠️ `credentials.json` and `token.json` are in `.gitignore` — never commit
> these files to GitHub.

---

## 4. Run the App Locally

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

- Click **"🔗 Connect to Google Calendar"** in the sidebar.
- A browser window will open asking you to log in and grant calendar access.
- After approval, a `token.json` file is created automatically so future runs
  won't need re-authentication.

---

## 5. Using the App

### Tab 1 — Upcoming Events
View your next 20 upcoming Google Calendar events in a table, with the
option to delete any of them.

### Tab 2 — Add Event
Create a new event directly on your Google Calendar (title, description,
location, date/time range).

### Tab 3 — Class Schedule
Add your recurring weekly classes (course name, instructor, days, time,
room). This is stored locally in `class_schedule.json` and will be used in
later weeks for conflict detection and automated scheduling.

---

## 6. Deploy on Streamlit Cloud

1. Push your code to GitHub (without `credentials.json` / `token.json`).
2. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io/) and sign in with GitHub.
3. Click **"New app"**, select your repo, branch (`main`), and main file (`app.py`).
4. **Important:** Since this app uses OAuth with a local browser flow
   (`run_local_server`), the Google sign-in won't work the same way on
   Streamlit Cloud. For the Week 1-2 demo, two options:
   - **Recommended for the milestone demo:** run the app **locally** and
     record your demo there — this satisfies "working deployed demo" for
     many course rubrics if you also deploy a static/limited version to
     Streamlit Cloud showing the UI (Class Schedule tab works fully online
     since it doesn't need Google auth).
   - **For a fully cloud-working version:** switch to a **Service Account**
     or implement the OAuth **web flow** with a redirect URI — this is a
     good Week 3-4 enhancement.
5. Add a `secrets.toml` (via Streamlit Cloud's "Secrets" settings) if you
   later store API keys there.

---

## 7. Recording Your 2-Minute Demo

Suggested flow:
1. (0:00–0:20) Briefly introduce the project: "Student Schedule Assistant —
   helps students manage classes, assignments, and calendar events."
2. (0:20–0:50) Show the **Class Schedule** tab: add a class, show it appear
   in the table.
3. (0:50–1:30) Show the **Connect to Google Calendar** button, then the
   **Upcoming Events** tab populating with real calendar data.
4. (1:30–2:00) Show **Add Event** — create an event and confirm it appears
   on your actual Google Calendar (switch to calendar.google.com briefly).
